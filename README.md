# LandRegistry

## Description
This project aims to develop a Blockchain-Based Land Registry Management System that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof recording of land ownership and transactions. The system will leverage the key features of blockchain—decentralization, immutability, and transparency—to eliminate fraud, reduce administrative overhead, and build trust among stakeholders, including government authorities, landowners, and buyers.
